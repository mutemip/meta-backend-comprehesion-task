"""
The oâ€‹utput is 2 because C derives from the immediate super class of C, and that's B.

The case above is an example of multi-level inheritance where the derived class C inherits from base class B. 
The class B is in turn a derived class of base class C. Class B here is an intermediary derived class. 
There are three levels of inheritance in this case, but it could be extended as long as I want, though it may become impractical after a while.
